        These diseases are caused by pathogens, but other factors such as age, nutritional deficiency, gender of an individual, and lifestyle also influence the disease. Examples include hypertension, diabetes, and cancer. They do not spread to others and they restrain within a person who has contracted them. Alzheimers, asthma, cataract and heart diseases are other non-infectious diseases.

                They are mainly caused by the malfunctioning of vital organs in the body due to the deterioration of cells over time. Diseases such as osteoporosis show characteristics of degenerative diseases in the form of increased bone weakness. This increases the risk of bone fractures.
<br>
When degeneration happens to the cells of the central nervous system, such as neurons, the condition is termed as a neurodegenerative disorder. Alzheimerâ€™s is a prominent example of this disorder. Degenerative diseases are usually caused by ageing and bodywear. Others are caused by lifestyle choices and some are hereditary.

There are many like these below ones:</div>

            <div class="accordion-body">An allergic reaction arises when the body becomes hypersensitive to certain foreign substances called allergens. This usually happens when the immune system reacts abnormally to any seemingly harmless substances. Common allergens include dust, pollen, animal dander, mites, feathers, latex and also certain food products like nuts and gluten. Peanuts and other nuts have the capability to cause severe allergic reactions that may induce life-threatening conditions such as difficulty in breathing, tissues swelling up and blocking the airways and anaphylaxis shock.
<br>
                Other common and less life-threatening symptoms include coughing, sneezing, running nose, itchy and red eyes, skin rashes. One of the best examples of this allergic reaction is asthma. Sometimes, bee stings and ant bites also trigger allergies. Consumption of shellfish and certain medication can induce allergic reactions.
                <br>
                Asthma is a chronic disease, mainly affects the bronchi and bronchioles of the lungs. One of the factors responsible for this is airborne allergens such as pollens or dust. Symptoms include difficulty in breathing, wheezing, and cough.</div>
